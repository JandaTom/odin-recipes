        <li>Cut bananas to bite-sized pieces, put them on a tray and let them freeze for about 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Once frozen, remove bananas from freezer and put them into blender. Start blending while slowly pouring in whole milk, until you have thick mixture.</li>
        <li>After that, add in some cocoa powder and blend again until mixed.</li>
        <li>Now, all you have to do is put the mixture into a bowl, cover it with a plastic wrap so that the wrap is touching surface of the mixture.
